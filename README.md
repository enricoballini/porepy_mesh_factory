# PorePy Mesh Factory
This repository is intended as a collection of tools for generation of computational meshes in fractured domains. The fracture networks and meshes can be accessed in (up to) three ways:
* In terms of the fracture network geometry, typically as a csv file
* As a gmsh .geo file, where the mesh can be generated, mesh sizes controlled etc.
* By import into [PorePy](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy), for use in simulations in fractured porous media.

While the latter is the main use case for this repository, the gmsh files can also be imported into other software.
